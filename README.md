Question:

Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.



Syntax:

adding data: "add <name> <department>"    // can also include 'to' between name and department

reading data: "get <name>" or "get all"
